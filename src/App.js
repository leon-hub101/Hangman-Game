    Fiddle my riddle one letter a time.
    I'm 16 letters long, don't get we wrong.
    10 miss guesses, your head is mine.

    Iâ€™m hard to grasp, a puzzle to see,
    You might scratch your head when dealing with me.
    I twist and turn, beyond clear sight,
    Understanding me can be quite a fight.
    What word am I, so tricky to find,
    A concept that baffles even the sharpest mind?
